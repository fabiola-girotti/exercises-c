# C Programming Exercises

This repository contains a collection of C programming exercises organized by class sessions. It was created as part of my learning journey through the basics of the C language.

## 📚 Structure

Each class contains a set of exercises, and each exercise is saved as a separate `.c` file with its own `main()` function.

basic-introduction/
├── exc-1.c
├── exc-2.c
├── exc-3.c
├── exc-4.c
└── exc-5.c


## ⚠️ Important

Each file contains its own `main()` function, so they **must be compiled separately**. Compiling them all at once will cause conflicts.

### Using Pelles C:
- Create a new project for each file (`exc-1.c`, `exc-2.c`, etc.)  
**OR**
- Keep only one `.c` file in the project at a time to avoid multiple `main()` functions.

## 📝 Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:

- Practice fundamental programming concepts in C  
- Organize exercises in a clean and modular way  
- Share progress and keep track of development
